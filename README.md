## 🔍 Building a Semantic Search Engine with Transformers

In this project, we’re developing an efficient **semantic search engine** using **Transformer models**. By leveraging **sentence-transformers** for text embeddings and **Faiss** for creating a search index, we’ll build a system that allows us to perform powerful searches across a collection of machine learning research papers. Let’s explore how modern search engines go beyond simple keyword matching! 📄🧠

## Project Overview

**Semantic search** is all about understanding the meaning behind words rather than just looking for exact keyword matches. In this project, we’ll use **sentence-transformers** to generate embeddings for research papers and **Faiss** to create an index for efficient searches. The system will allow us to search the corpus for relevant papers based on the semantic similarity of the content, even if the exact words don’t appear in the query.

We’ll preprocess the dataset with **scikit-learn**, create the search index with **Faiss**, and perform a few experiments to see how well the search engine retrieves relevant articles based on natural language queries.

### Key Features:

- 🧠 **Semantic Embeddings**: Use the **sentence-transformers** library to generate semantically meaningful text embeddings.
- 🔍 **Efficient Search Index**: Build a **Faiss**-based search index for k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) search.
- 🧪 **Search Experiments**: Conduct experiments with machine learning research papers, retrieving articles based on text summaries and queries.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset using **scikit-learn** for clean and efficient embedding generation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **sentence-transformers**: For generating semantic embeddings from natural language text.
- **Faiss**: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing the dataset and handling data transformations.
